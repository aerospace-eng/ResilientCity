Project Overview
ResilientCity is a project designed to support survival and recovery 
after large-scale disasters such as earthquakes or nuclear incidents. 
The system integrates emergency kits, seed preservation capsules, and
reinforced public buildings to provide communities with safe shelter
and sustainable living spaces.

The project focuses on transforming existing structures—like hospitals,
schools, and military bases—into adaptable safe zones, while deploying low-cost, 
community-level emergency resources. Each capsule represents hope, and each structure symbolizes
resilience and rebirth, ensuring that cities can recover and thrive even after devastating events.
